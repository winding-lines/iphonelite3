WHAT?
XCode3 iPhone project with Lite3* classes for serialization and deserialization of arbitrary classes to a sqlite3 database.

The library classes come from their own repository
http://github.com/decodeideas/iphonelite3-lib.git

Also I integrated the Unit tests from the Google Toolkit for Mac.

The current project is using Objective-C reflection instead of inheritance. It is a lot simpler than the above projects partially due to the lack of features.

Look in the file Test/Lite3DBTest.m for example of usage. Generally the database will be created and deployed with the application so that you can ship pre-filled tables. The other option is to create the database upon first usage by providing the DDL.
