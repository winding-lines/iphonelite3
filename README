WHAT?
XCode3 iPhone project with Lite3* classes for serialization and deserialization of arbitrary classes to a sqlite3 database.

Also I integrated the Unit tests from the Google Toolkit for Mac.

THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA STAGE. I am working on it as part of another application and I am implementing and sharing features as I need them.

OTHER PROJECTS
1. One day after I created this project I found the following project through the iPhone dev twitter list.

http://code.google.com/p/sqlitepersistentobjects/

2. The following is using the ActiveRecord approach of inheriting from a basic class.

IPHONELITE3	

The current project is using Objective-C reflection instead of inheritance. It is a lot simpler than the above projects partially due to the lack of features.

Look in the file Test/Lite3DBTest.m for example of usage. Generally the database will be created and deployed with the application so that you can ship pre-filled tables. The other option is to create the database upon first usage by providing the DDL.
