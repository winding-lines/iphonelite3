These are the main classes of your project. The classes for which you have unit tests need to belong to both Targets. To Add a class to a target make sure that the given target is the active one. In then main Project window in the top right corner look for a target icon (two concentric circles). Select the checkbox in that column for the class that needs to be added to the Active Target.
